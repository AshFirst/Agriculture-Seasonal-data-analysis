# Agriculture Data Analysis (Snowflake + Power BI)
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing agricultural data by integrating Snowflake as the data warehouse and Power BI for visualization. The dataset was processed in Snowflake using SQL, and the transformed data was then imported into Power BI to generate insights.

## Data Flow
Snowflake as Data Source
The original dataset was stored in Snowflake.
Data transformations were applied, including rainfall and area adjustments, year grouping, and rainfall classification.
Power BI for Visualization
The transformed dataset was imported into Power BI.
Reports and dashboards were created for analysis.
Data Transformations
Rainfall and Area Adjustments:
Rainfall values were increased, and area values were reduced to normalize the data.
Year Grouping:
The dataset was divided into three time periods for better trend analysis.
Rainfall Classification:
Rainfall values were categorized into "Low," "Medium," and "High" groups based on predefined thresholds.

## Tools & Technologies Used
Data Warehouse: Snowflake
Query Language: SQL
Visualization Tool: Power BI
Execution Environment: Snowflake Worksheets

## How to Use This Project
Connect Power BI to Snowflake and import the transformed dataset.
Use Power BI to create visualizations based on the data insights.
Modify the data processing steps in Snowflake as needed for further analysis.
